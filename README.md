# automatic_differentiation
This repository provides a simple neural network framework with automatic differentiation. It includes base modules like neurons (MyNeuron), layers (MyLayer), and a multi-layer perceptron (MyMLP) to build custom networks. Designed for educational purposes, it enables easy experimentation with architectures and training routines.
